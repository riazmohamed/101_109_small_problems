# Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (Ëš) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. There are 60 minutes in a degree, and 60 seconds in a minute.
